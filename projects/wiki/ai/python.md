# Pydoc
- Every install of python comes with this service that can generate a web-server for your documentation.
```
console
python -m pydoc
python -m pydoc math
python -m pydoc pow
python -m -k ftp
python -m pydoc -k sql
python -m pydoc -b
```
# Numpy
- Web API documentation: [numpy doc](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)
- Using the most widely adopted abbreviation: `import numpy as np`
- We create two vector arrays, first one by declaring the min and max values and how many elements will have. The second vector will be derived from the first one where $f(x)$ is just a linear function. E.g. $f(x) = a * x + b$ with both $a$ and $b$ constants.
```console
x = np.linsapce(start, end, how_many)
y = f(x)
```

# Scikit-learn
- Web API documentation: [scikit-learn doc](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)

# TensorFlow
- Web API documentation: [tensor-flow doc](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/all_symbols)
